# Welcome to EduGPT

EduGPT is a science and natural history education app incorporating gameified elements with an AI tutor built in. Currently, the focus is on building out the Chemistry learning tree, however there will be a focus on Geography, Physics and Astronomy modules as the app develops.

The initial stage of development will be centered around building out the visual style of the learning modules.

## Where is this deployed?

Currently, EduGPT is hosted on Vercel and does not have its own domain. This will change in the future as we expect to bring on beta users.

#### Front End

Next.js (Pages Router)
